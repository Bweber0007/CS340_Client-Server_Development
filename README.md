dashboard project presenting interactive tables/charts with data from a database


How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In order to write maintainable and adaptable programs I follow Object-Oriented programming principles which allows the code to be easily adaptable to different situations. For it to be readable, I integrate simple comments that help to clarify functions purposes. Working with these concepts in mind helped me to come back to my own work after taking a break from it -- simple comments clarified my own thought process when reviewing my code and OOP principles helped to keep my work modular and organized. The CRUD python module allowed for interacting with a MongoDB database and could be adapted for any future MongoDB projects I am working on that would benefit from simplified interface for querying data from the database.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I believe that it is helpful when approaching a problem to view it top-down and go breadth before depth. It can be beneficial to try to understand how the pieces should interact before creating each individual piece. For this project, it followed an MVC design pattern and the model was previously implemented for the database. So the view and controller pieces still needed to be implemented. By starting with the view first, it helped to create a baseline for the controller later on. It would have been more difficult to design a controller without having my variables and layout from the view. Much like starting a PB&J with peanut butter and jelly instead of the bread. My approach for this project didn't differ a whole lot from assignments in other courses. The general process of a top-down approach is how I have always tried to tackle problems. However, I believe that the more problems that I encounter within different areas of computer science, the more proficient and comfortable I become with my process. Its hard to say what other techniques or strategies I'd use with other clients, perhaps creating a more robust database helper class that could implement more complex queries.



What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I believe it is a computer scientist's job to connect other people with technology. It matters because there are many people in the world who do not have the knowledge that it requires to have in-depth interactions with technology the way computer scientists can. By facilitating others' interactions, they are able to utilize the incredible power computers offer to accomplish goals and bring their ideas to life. 100 years ago, people had ideas that seemed impossible; today, sometimes all it takes is a computer scientist.
